## Make Change Project - Week 1 Skill Distillery 

### Overview 
In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer.

### Technologies Used
- Eclipse
- Java
- Terminal Commands
- GitHub


### Lessons Learned
I had to review the material covered in the past week of the program to choose the best and shortest way to do the program. 
Issues that came up had to do with int, doubles, and rounding values.
I learned how to use Math.round, as well as was able to practice returning values from methods and casting data types. I also came to the conclusion that often easiest methods to build a program can create less issues in the testing phase than more advanced methods.

### MVP
The user will be prompted to enter the cost of item.
 - User enters the amount.
 
 The user will then be prompted to enter the amount tendered.
 - User enters the amount.
 
 The program will calculate the amount of change based on the numbers provided by the user.
 - program displays change amount, as well as how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer.
